study README.md study implementation-plan.md and one pick and only one of the most important thing to do

IMPORTANT:

- update the implementation plan when the task is done
- you may implement missing functionaltiy if required (but study the specs/ before doing so)
- author property based tests or unit tests (which ever is best)
- after making the changes to the files run the tests
- when tests pass, commit and push to deploy the changes
- if integration/property/unit tests are missing you should add them (but choose which one is most appropraite. follow existing test pattern design)
